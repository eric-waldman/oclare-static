**OCLaRE** is a web-based application that acts as an academic methodology toolbox. As such, **OCLaRE** helps enhance the production of a lab report or an academic paper by offering specific tools for gathering information, planning, analyzing and writing collaborative lab reports and research papers. Teachers may customize the application by specifying the sections to be included in the report or academic paper, the type and the nature of data to be entered, how the data may be analyzed, as well as identify the sections of the report that the students are to complete.
